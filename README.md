##Solving Real-World Data Science Tasks with Python Pandas:
---
"This project aims to demonstrate the application of Python Pandas library to solve real-world data science tasks using a sales dataset. The dataset contains information about sales transactions, including columns such as 'Order ID', 'Product', 'Quantity Ordered', 'Price Each', 'Order Date', and 'Purchase Address'."

#Project Tasks:
**Merge 12 Months of Sales Data:**

	-Combine the sales data from 12 different CSV files into a single CSV file for easier analysis.
**Data Cleaning:**

	-Handle any missing values (NaN) in the dataset using the dropna() function to ensure data integrity.
**Data Preparation:**

	-Calculate the total sales by multiplying the 'Quantity Ordered' with 'Price Each' to create a new 'Sales' column.
	-Extract the city from the 'Purchase Address' column and add a new 'City' column to identify sales by city.
**Best Sales Months:**

	-Group the data by months to identify the total sales for each month using groupby().
	-Visualize the monthly sales using plt to identify the best-performing months.
**City with the Highest Number of Sales:**

	-Group the data by city to determine the total sales for each city using groupby().
	-Use plt to visualize the sales in different cities and identify the city with the highest sales.
**Displaying Advertisements for Maximum Sales:**

	-Convert the 'Order Date' column to datetime format using pd.to_datetime for time-based analysis.
	-Group the data by hour to determine the likelihood of customer buying products at different hours.
	-Use plt.plot() to visualize the sales trend throughout the day and decide the best time to display advertisements.
**Products Often Sold Together:**

	-Identify products that are frequently sold together based on the 'Order ID'.
	-Use pandas' advanced techniques like grouping and aggregating to find the most commonly paired products.
#Project Dependencies:
	-The project uses Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, as well as Matplotlib for data visualization.

#Libraries Used:
	-pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
	-matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization.
	-os: For interacting with the operating system and managing file paths.
	-itertools.combinations: To find combinations of products frequently sold together.
	-collections.Counter: For counting occurrences of products sold together.

#Conclusion:
By solving real-world data science tasks using Python Pandas, this project showcases how data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis can lead to valuable insights. The project helps identify the best-selling months, cities with the highest sales, and optimal times for advertising to maximize customer purchases. Additionally, it reveals products that are commonly sold together, aiding in strategic decision-making for the sales and marketing teams. The project provides valuable lessons in data handling and serves as a starting point for similar data analysis tasks in various industries.
